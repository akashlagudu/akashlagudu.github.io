        <h1 style="text-align:left">Itachi is the one of the best character in Naruto, I think whoever gonna fight him should be from the Uchiha clan(can break genjutsu). Otherwise, it should be Gai sensei who can fight without looking at their parts of the body or their eyes. And also the last moment of Itachi made me a little cry:(.

        <p><b>His Susanoo(wind god) is way too op compared to the other Susanoo's user in the same form, his Susanoo has a "Yata mirror" ,a shield that can reflect all things (this is already op), and a "Totsuka blade" that can seal anything it stabbed. Moreover, He can use Tsukuyomi (which is a weaker version of "Infinite Tsukuyomi"(god of the moon)) a genjutsu that can control the time and space of genjutsu. (Kakashi being stabbed for 72 hours in Tsukuyomi world, but actually in 1 second in the real world. The last one is he can use Izanami to get the victim being in a loop of time.</b></p>
